Scripts and programs I've written for classwork or to make life easier

branchpred.py- Script for an assignment that accepted a file of unknown size containing hex addresses, an '@' or '.' symbol then another hex address on every line. This was to, in a very basic way, simulate different algorithms that exist for predicting if branches were to be taken or not.
